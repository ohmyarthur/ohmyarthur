# Hey 👋, I’m Dias Arthur 

Independent developer exploring algorithms, systems, and open-source design.  
I focus on performance, and building things that just work.

+ 🧠 : Exploring runtime optimization, and language-level abstractions.  
+ 💡 : I like hackathons, deep dives, and late-night refactors that make everything cleaner.  
+ 🌿 : MBTI — INTJ.  
+ 🖋 : Exploring the balance between structure and chaos — in code and in life.
